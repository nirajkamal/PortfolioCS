# Image Requirements for Updated PyTorch Blog

## New Images Needed

Add these images to: `src/assets/blogs/Pytorch_Course/10_21_2025_Reflection_Post/`

### Required Images:

1. **typical_lab_structure.png**
   - Replaces the old "lab_structuree.png"
   - Description: Visual showing the typical structure/flow of each lab

2. **course_launch.png**
   - Course launch photo/screenshot from PyTorch Conference 2025
   - Used in the "Official Launch" section

3. **Behind the Scenes - Figma/Storyboard Images:**
   - `figma_prototype_1.png` - First Figma design prototype
   - `storyboard_1.png` - First storyboard iteration
   - `figma_prototype_2.png` - Second Figma design prototype
   - `storyboard_2.png` - Second storyboard iteration

## Existing Images (Still Used):

- `code_model_class.png` ✓
- `Dataloader_explanation.png` ✓ (with new note about internship improvements)

## Removed Images:

- `Neural_Network_diagram.png` ✗ (removed from main content as requested)

## Next Steps:

1. Add the new images to the folder
2. Run: `npm run copy-images` to copy to public folder
3. Run: `npm run build && npm run deploy` from root directory

The blog will automatically pick up the images!
