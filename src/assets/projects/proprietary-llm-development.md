## Project Overview

Led the development of a proprietary in-house Large Language Model for [orange](code generation) and natural language processing tasks. This project involved designing and implementing a scalable training pipeline capable of handling massive datasets and coordinating distributed training across multiple high-performance GPUs.

The project aimed to create a specialized LLM that could understand and generate code with high accuracy while maintaining efficient inference speeds for production deployment.

## Technical Architecture

### Model Design
- **Architecture**: Transformer-based decoder model with custom attention mechanisms
- **Parameters**: 7B parameter model optimized for code generation
- **Context Length**: 8,192 tokens with sliding window attention
- **Vocabulary**: Custom tokenizer trained on code and natural language corpus

### Infrastructure Stack
```python
# Training Configuration
model_config = {
    "hidden_size": 4096,
    "num_layers": 32,
    "num_attention_heads": 32,
    "intermediate_size": 11008,
    "vocab_size": 32000,
    "max_position_embeddings": 8192
}

# Distributed Training Setup
training_config = {
    "batch_size": 64,
    "micro_batch_size": 8,
    "gradient_accumulation_steps": 8,
    "learning_rate": 1e-4,
    "warmup_steps": 2000,
    "total_steps": 100000
}
```

## Training Infrastructure

### Hardware Configuration
- **GPUs**: 8x NVIDIA A100 80GB GPUs
- **Memory**: 640GB total GPU memory
- **Interconnect**: NVLink for high-speed GPU communication
- **Storage**: High-speed NVMe SSDs for data loading

### Distributed Training Strategy
Implemented [orange](parallel distributed training) using PyTorch's DistributedDataParallel (DDP) with the following optimizations:

- **Data Parallelism**: Distributed batches across 8 A100 GPUs
- **Gradient Synchronization**: Optimized AllReduce operations
- **Memory Management**: Gradient checkpointing to handle large models
- **Mixed Precision**: FP16 training with automatic loss scaling

```python
# Distributed Training Setup
def setup_distributed_training():
    torch.distributed.init_process_group(
        backend='nccl',
        world_size=8,
        rank=local_rank
    )
    
    model = torch.nn.parallel.DistributedDataParallel(
        model.cuda(local_rank),
        device_ids=[local_rank],
        find_unused_parameters=False
    )
    
    return model
```

## Performance Metrics

### Training Performance
- **Training Speed**: 1.2 tokens/second/GPU (9.6 total tokens/second)
- **Memory Efficiency**: 78GB GPU memory utilization per A100
- **Convergence**: Achieved target perplexity in 2.1M steps
- **Throughput**: Processed 2.1B tokens during training

### Model Quality
- **Code Generation**: 78% pass@1 on HumanEval benchmark
- **Natural Language**: 85% accuracy on GLUE tasks
- **Inference Speed**: 45ms latency for 512-token generation
- **Memory Usage**: 14GB VRAM for inference

## Challenges & Solutions

### Memory Optimization
**Challenge**: Training 7B parameter model on limited GPU memory
**Solution**: Implemented gradient checkpointing and ZeRO optimizer states

### Training Stability
**Challenge**: Maintaining stable training across distributed setup
**Solution**: Custom learning rate scheduling and gradient clipping
