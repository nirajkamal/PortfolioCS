## Summer 2020 Diaries: TU Dresden

### Preface

I spent my last semester (and a couple more months so far) working on digital and programmable architecture, at the knowledge architecture laboratory in TU Dresden, Germany. I had to extend my stay beyond July 2020 to complete my projects, as they got delayed a bit during the CoVID pandemic. I am being supported by a DAAD scholarship and TU Dresden. It has been an adventure, and I have experienced a lot of surprises, twists and turns throughout the journey. I also had a chance to work on a part-time internship at an architecture firm for a couple of months. Dresden is an architectural feast for the eyes, with its rich culture and people it inhabits from all around the world. The institute administration and foreign offices in Germany have been amicable and supportive throughout the stay and during the pandemic.
